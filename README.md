# advent of code @ 2022

my goal is to use different languages each day and hopefully not explode, the insaner the better

(also go take a look at [ven's](https://github.com/Vendicated/AOC22/) and [manti's](https://github.com/mantikafasi/advent-of-code-2022) repos!!)

# running

i am too lazy to make build files. the general rule is all programs take input from stdin and output to stdout plainly

# history

- day 01: [uwuified python bytecode](https://github.com/dzshn/uwu) ([part 1](01/pt1.py), [part 2](01/pt2.py))

  originally written normally but i got too bored of that :3
- day 02: [golfscript](http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript/) ([part 1](02/pt1.gs), [part 2](02/pt2.gs))

  rather insane language, i used only 27 characters for part 1. part 2 unfortunately has 61 characters cuz my brain farded and i just did it the boring mapping way
- day 03: [Racket lisp](https://racket-lang.org/) ([part 1](03/pt1.rkt), [part 2](03/pt1.rkt))

  not too fond of lisp.
- day 04: [Tcl](https://www.tcl-lang.org/) ([part 1](04/pt1.tcl), [part 2](04/pt2.tcl))

  this one was actually pretty nice to use
- day 05: [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)) ([part 1](05/pt1.adb), [part 2](05/pt2.adb))

  [Help! Get_line is insane!](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.ada/c/t58iiAUz6cI) (this was the most painful language so far)
- day 06: Elixir ([part 1](06/pt1.ex), [part 2](06/pt2.ex))

  i like how concise my solution is but dear god what is elixir syntax
- day 07: [D](https://dlang.org/) ([part 1](07/pt1.d), [part 2](07/pt2.d))

  `goto` my beloved <3
- day 08: [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) ([part 1](08/pt1.lua), [part 2](08/pt2.lua))

  The Brazilian government will seize all my belongings if I state my opinions on the language.
- day 09: [LisPy](https://github.com/dzshn/lispy) ([part 1](09/pt1.lpy))

  i developed a terrible lisp from doing racket earlier. but like i actually did and it sucks so much it takes 10 minutes to solve part 1 and it also eats 250 mb of ram lmaooo

  please check out the repo for it i've gone insane
